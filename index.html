        So I was in the middle of downtown with a beautiful date until a moment of disturbance occured. I felt a heavy drop in the lower part of my belly, my stomach began to turn and next thing I knew, I was ground hogging. I pulled my phone out, uploaded the good to go bathroom app and found the nearest bathroom of 3 stars or more with seconds to spare. I dragged my date to the designated restaurant, told her to order, ran to bathroom and TOOK CARE OF BUSINESS!  Thanks to good 2 go app, I saved a pair of new jeans, felt comforatble while taking a shit and even saved my date by taking me to a restaurant to keep my date waiting while I had to go.

      <p>As a young and single father living in downtown Seattle, it is really helpful to know which bathrooms in my area equipped with baby changing stations so I dont stink up my apartment.
