Condensed User Scenarios:

As a person who has to go to the bathroom, I need to know whether the bathroom is accessible without purchasing something.

As a person with a handicap. I need to know whether there's a handicap accessible stall for me to use.

As someone that has a family, I need to know if there is a fold down diaper changing station.

As someone that cares about cleanliness, I need to find a bathroom I feel is clean for me to use.

As someone that is a diabetic, I need to know if there is a needle dispenser within the facility.

User Stories:
As a bathroom user with specific accessibility needs, I want to be able to filter the bathrooms that fits my needs.

As a user I'd like to be able to enter my own restroom data, and leave reviews of places I've been.

PROBLEM DOMAIN:  
As a bathroom user I want a place where I can see a list of reviews from other bathroom users so I can know before I go.  I also want to be able to leave my own feedback on bathrooms I've been to and add my review to the list.

The list should inform me of the location of the bathroom and should have a link to the establishment it is associated with. The list should also inform me about the amenities the bathroom provides in order for me to know if the bathroom fits my needs.

STRETCH GOALS:  
I want to be able to re-order the list so that I see only the  results most relevant to me at the top
I want to be able to see bathroom locations on a map.
I want to be able to enter a location and sort bathrooms based on how near they are to me.
As a use I want to be able to choose a unique avatar to represent myself
