    Here at Go On The Go, we are passionate about accessbile restrooms with the necessar amenities for custom situations. We feel for the parent needing to change their child, concerned about sanitation in public bathrooms. We work for the handicap needing ramps and handle bars for assistance. We reach out to the transgender or non-binary community members by sharing unisex bathroom locations. We understand there are a wide range of confort zones and needs for every day poeple. We work hard in sharing info with the public so when nature calls, you'll be ready to go.
