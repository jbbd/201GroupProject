  <main class="about"> Here at Go On The Go, we are passionate about accessbile
    restrooms with necessary amenities for custom situations. We feel for the
    parent needing to change their child, concerned about the sanitation in public
    bathrooms. We work for the handicap needing ramps and handle bars for assistance.
    We reach out to the transgender or non-binary community members to feel comfortable
    when nature calls. We understand there are a wide range of confort zones and
    needs for every day poeple to feel comfortable.
